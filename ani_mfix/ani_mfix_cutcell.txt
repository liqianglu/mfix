Animate_mfix : 2D cut-cell usage / notes


1. Download the latest devlopment version from the MFIX website

2. The executable is in mfix/ani_mfix/Linux/ani_mfix_intel_64bit.exe
   It is a 64 bit Linux executable (so at NETL, use on HPC).

3. 2D cut-cell runs usage

   a.  The code looks for the cut-cell geometry data in the
       file : ani_cutcell.vtk

   b.  copy one of the time dependent VTK files created when
       MFIX is run to that filename.

   c.  Run the animate_mfix_64bits.exe downloaded from the website



4. Notes

   a. If ani_cutcell.vtk is not found or it is a 3D case, the
      animation code will run as if it is not a cut-cell case.

   b. The first time animate is run, there will be a delay
      while the code reads the ani_cutcell.vtk file and maps
      the polygons specified in that file with the MFIX-IJK 
      cell that they correspond to.  The mapping information is
      written to the cutcell_map.txt.

   c. The SP* files are used in the animation, not the time
      dependent VTK files.  Therefore,  you will need to change
      the output SPX_DT values if you run the cut-cell tutorials.

Task   : Finish netCDF support in MFIX

Result : Able to (optionally) create netCDF files in
         MFIX (on NCCS and HPC).  Ability to post process
         netCDF output (animate / post / Ensight)


Task   : Investigate and implement parallel netCDF in MFIX

Result : Based on some benchmarks done by Aytekin, this could
         reduce wall clock time by 10 to 30 percent.



Task   : Investigate ways to post process very large runs.  This
         could include creating spatial subsets or grids with
         every other cell.

Result : Ability to process very large runs on a single processor,
         without having to modify the post processing codes to
         use MPI.

Phil, 

I just ran over to the office to check and the signature page was not received.  Please ask him to re-send and make sure he is sending to the correct fax number.  304-599-8904. (Becky Sell)

Greg,

FYI : below are the performance review comments from DOE
on your work.  

 
Excellent support has been provided by Aeolus personnel in the 
systems administration of the SciLAN and computational clusters 
in ORD.  Aeolus support of procurement and installation of 
new clusters has been excellent.  

I am supposed to "review these and discuss them with those 
                  that support you".

Good Job !  There ... I have officially discussed them with
you.  Seriously, let me if you have any questions/comments.

Thanks,
Phil

                         670.01.01 

The actuals costs are under plan because Ansys(Fluent) has
been working at less than plan.  They are planning to
make the time up in the next period.

Here is an exerpt from an email from Ansys on this subject:

"The plan is to use more resources to come back up to 4 FTEs.  
Part of the problem is that one of the projects in 670.01.01, 
is still not well defined.  This is the "CO2 capture using sorbent".  
I have been planning to get help from two engineers from the NH 
office.  But, since the scope is not well determined, I'm not 
able to pass on any thing meaningful to them."

-------------------------------------------------------------

                          670.01.06

The actuals are under plan because:

1) Ansys employee working on this task left the company during
   and was not replaced.

2) Even while still with the company, the employee worked
   less than plan hours

This work will not be made up in the next period.  Ansys is
not planning on replacing the employee.  The plan is for DOE
to take the Ansys task out of the SOW and re-submit to RDS,
but this has not occurred yet.






---------------------------------------------------------------------
Every 4 months or so, I have to compare the actual costs versus
the plan costs for RDS management, and if there is more than
a 10 percent difference, I need to explain why.

I noticed that Ansys' actual charges are quite a bit under plan
in 670.01.01.

Part of that was because I inflated the Aug/Sep/Oct plan to have 
5 full time FTEs instead of 4.  From November on, the plan calls
for 4 full time FTEs.  It is the period starting with November
than I am looking at now.

In November and December, Ansys only worked to about 57 percent
of the plan (probably due to the holidays).

   plan hours   = 1302
   actual hours ~  737


So my question : From March thru October, do you expect to be 
                 working slightly more than the plan (which
                 is 4 FTE ... with some vacation taken in), or
                 to just continue to work at plan ?

Here are the number of FTE hours for 1 full time employee in these months:

March     : 192
April     : 154
May       : 154
June      : 184
July      : 146
August    : 154
September : 184
October   : 146

1. merge 28-aug-2007

   Loop thru the "combined" file below. Get the MasterPlat_ID ... find it
   in "OIL FMP_PLATS.xls" put the corresponding Oil FMP number in that file
   into the "combined file"


2. compare fields in 2 files

   Loop thru the "active" .. for each FMP, see if it is in the 
   "masterplatfile" if not found ... output it to a list.

                                   PIO

10-sep-2007

This is strange as READ_RES0 and READ_RES1 have not been changed.
And if you can do a restart_2 with the version of MFIX without
any IO changes, you should be able to read the file with the
distributed IO changes.


Since the following gets printed out:

0 :CHK2: READ_RES1:203  1.60000002

I assume that the problem occurs during the 

call readScatterRes(GAMA_RG, array2, array1, NEXT_REC)

1) What is NEXT_REC before the call ? Compare that value to the
version of MFIX without distributed IO changes.

2) In allocate_arrays , verify that dimension_3p = dimension_3
(approximately line 71). This is just to make sure that all
the arrays are being allocated so we are not overwriting memory
anywhere.


3) could you zip and send to me the entire source, so I can take 
a quick look at the other routines.
