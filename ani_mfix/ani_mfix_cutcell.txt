Animate_mfix : 2D cut-cell usage / notes


1. Download the latest devlopment version from the MFIX website

2. The executable is in mfix/ani_mfix/Linux/ani_mfix_intel_64bit.exe
   It is a 64 bit Linux executable (so at NETL, use on HPC).

   You will probably need to make it executable:

   chmod +x ani_mfix_intel_64bit.exe

3. 2D cut-cell runs usage

   a.  The code looks for the cut-cell geometry data in the
       file : ani_cutcell.vtk

   b.  It should automatically be created in 2D cutcell cases.  If
       not, copy one of the time dependent VTK files created when
       MFIX is run to that filename.

   c.  Run the animate_mfix_64bits.exe downloaded from the website



4. Notes

   a. If ani_cutcell.vtk is not found or it is a 3D case, the
      animation code will run as if it is not a cut-cell case.

   b. The first time animate is run, there will be a delay
      while the code reads the ani_cutcell.vtk file and maps
      the polygons specified in that file with the MFIX-IJK 
      cell that they correspond to.  The mapping information is
      written to the cutcell_map.txt.

   c. The SP* files are used in the animation, not the time
      dependent VTK files.  Therefore,  you will need to change
      the output SPX_DT values if you run the cut-cell tutorials.
