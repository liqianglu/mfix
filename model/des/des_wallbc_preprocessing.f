!  Purpose: subroutines for pre-processing wall info for discrete      C
!           simulations  when cutcell is used.                         C
!           Most of this routine (except the particle deletion stuff)  C
!           was developed when quadric representation was used for     C
!           cutcell. Since STL works better, most of this routine will C
!           be soon deprecated.                                        C
