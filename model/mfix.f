!!
!! MFIX is a general-purpose computer code developed at the National
!! Energy Technology Laboratory, NETL, for describing the hydrodynamics,
!! heat transfer, and chemical reactions in fluid-solid systems.
!!
!! It has been used for describing bubbling and circulating fluidized
!! beds and spouted beds. MFiX calculations give transient data on the
!! three-dimensional distribution of pressure, velocity, temperature,
!! and species mass fractions. MFiX code is based on a generally
!! accepted set of multiphase flow equations. The code is used as a
!! "test-stand" for testing and developing multiphase flow constitutive
!!  equations.
