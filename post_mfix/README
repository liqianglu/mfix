1.  For compiling post_mfix ../model directory must exist.  All the common
files between post_mfix and mfix are stored in the model
directory.  (Only exception is function.inc.  For post_mfix fun_ijk is made
the same as funijk_io. make_post takes care of using the correct function.inc.)

2.  If function.inc is updated ensure that those changes are made in the
post_mfix version of function.inc. 

2.  If new variables are added to write_res1, ensure that they are updated
in interp_res.

3.  DEALLOCATE_ARRAYS deallocates all arrays allocated in ALLOCATE_ARRAYS. Update this routine whenever ALLOCATE_ARRAYS is updated.
