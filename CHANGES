Changes from MFIX2012-1 (Date: 01/19/2012) to MFIX2013-1 (Date: 03/05/2013)


New features added:
-------------------

* Hybrid model 
   o Ability to describe different solids phases in either Eulerian or Lagrangian frames

* MPPIC (Multi-Phase Particle in Cell)
  o Eulerian model for carrier phase coupled with particle-in-cell (PIC) based discrete representation for dispersed phase
  o Tentative release to handle cut-cells

* DEM
  o Tentative release to handle cut-cells



Changes in existing features:
-----------------------------

* Bug fixes and enhancements:
  o Makefile: improved user input
    - Improved user input
    - Object files are stored in dedicated directories to speed-up recompilation

* Reaction rate input
  o New user-friendly input method to define chemical reactions in input file
  o Simplification of user-defined reaction rate specification
  o Heats of reaction are automatically calculated

* Parallel execution
  o SMP mode of execution was turned off due to current assesment of OpenMP directives

* Cartesian Grid cut cell technique
  o Improvement in handling geometry intersections
  o Geometry input from multiple STL files



* Documentation:
----------------

* Updated documents:
  o Readme file [1]
  o Cartesian grid documentation [2]

* New documents:
  o MMPIC documentation [3]
  o MPI verification [4]
  o Compiler study [5]



Under Development:
------------------

* Stiff solver: Automatic parsing to elimnate user-input for Direct Integration method

* Variable solids density 
  o Ability to have solids density vary as a function of species composition (Eulerian/Eulerian solver)

* Parallel execution
  o Updated OpenMP directives



Project Metrics:
----------------

* Change from 2012-1 Release:
  o 20 new files
  o Over 11,000 new lines of code (around 7,000 excluding comments and blank lines)

* 2013-1 Total count:
  o Files: 539
  o Lines: 192,460
  o Blank Lines: 25,376
  o Code Lines: 114,993
