Changes from MFIX2013-2 (Date: 09/18/2013) to MFIX2014-1 (Date: 10/01/2014)


Note for MFIX 2013-2 users
--------------------------

Some feature improvements are fairly aggressive and required major
changes to the code. As a result, backward compatibility is not
guaranteed for either input or restart files. Please contact the
development team through the mailing list (See User Guide [1]) if you
have difficulties running a previous model with the new release.

New features added:
-------------------

* Variable solids density
  o The material density of a solids phase changes as a result of
    chemical reactions (changing species composition) with the
    assumption that the solids volume fraction remains constant.

* DEM Complex boundaries
  o The DEM/Cartesian cut-cell implementation was updated such that
    boundaries (walls) can be defined through STL files. This change
    allows for greater geometry complexity with better particle-wall
    collision detection.

Changes in existing features:
-----------------------------

* DEM code refactoring for better performance gave a 4x speedup
  compared to the Release 2013-2 (for tutorials/FluidBed_DES with 38,400
  particles running in serial.)

* DEM particle configuration is based on initial condition settings
  (e.g., IC_EP_s).

* Cartesian grid cut-cell re-indexing method was implemented to
  re-order cells when a large number of inactive cells are
  generated. This provides a more efficient way of looping through
  computational cells which can substantially speedup the code
  execution for complex geometries.

* The make_mfix build script was completely overhauled.

  o Build script was split into several files/scripts.

  o Build settings can be passed as build arguments.

  o Parallel-make build support.

  o Automatic Makefile generation at build time for dependency
    detection.

  o Each supported system and compiler has its own settings file
    allowing for easier modification and maintenance.

* Improved checks for user input

  o Checks on solids model specifications are restricted to the solids
    model type so that unnecessary data is no longer needed. This
    improvement applies mainly to DEM and PIC solids models.

  o Error messages are consistently managed based on user input
    settings. If FULL_LOG is specified, error messages are written the
    LOG file and sent to std-out. Otherwise, error messages are only
    written to the LOG file.

* Documentation:

* Updated documentation:
  o Readme file renamed to MFIX User Guide  [1]


Community Involvement:
------------------


* Improved center-line treatment for cylindrical coordinate systems.

  three-dimensional simulation of dense multi-phase flows using
  cylindrical coordinates," Powder Technology, 264:242-255.


* A shape dependent particle-fluid drag coefficient was used to create
  a tutorial for the new user defined drag functions (see
  mfix/tutorials/usr_drag).

  shape-dependent particle-fluid drag coefficient law in the

Project Metrics:
----------------

* Change from 2013-2 Release:
  o 46 files and about 6,000 lines of code were added (net count)

* 2014-1 Total count:
  o Files: 572
  o Lines: 211,825
  o Blank Lines: 32,272
  o Code Lines: 120,990
  o Comment Lines: 62,139
  o Statements: 87,625
