Changes from MFIX2013-1 (Date: 03/05/2013) to MFIX2013-2 (Date: 09/18/2013)


New features added:
-------------------

* Stiff chemistry model
  o The stiff chemistry solver was completely overhauled to eliminate any user coding.
    This capability can now be activated with a single keyword.

* Point Source
  o The ability to specify mass inlet point source anywhere in the domain was added.
    This can be useful when modeling a small side inlet, without having to resolve the
    actual geometry.

* Subgrid models
  o The two-fluid Igci and Milioli filtered models were implemented and can be activated by new keywords.

* DEM cluster detection
  o An algorithm to detect clusters and collect information was implemented.


Changes in existing features:
-----------------------------

* Parallel execution
  o The SMP directives have been updated in key-subroutines. The SMP compilation
    options (including hybrid SMP+DMP) have been turned back on. Please note that
    the reported CPU time may be inaccurate in SMP mode.

* Bug fixes and enhancements:
  o Cyclic boundaries with pressure drop: flags CYCLIC_AT_E/N/T were corrected



* Documentation:
----------------

* Updated documents:
  o Readme file [1]


Under Development:
------------------

* Variable solids density 
  o Ability to have solids density vary as a function of species composition (Eulerian/Eulerian solver)



Project Metrics:
----------------

* Change from 2013-1 Release:
  o 13 files were removed due to stiff-solver overhaul (net count)
  o Over 3,000 new lines of code (net count)

* 2013-2 Total count:
  o Files: 526
  o Lines: 195,755
  o Blank Lines: 26,750
  o Code Lines: 116,321
  o Comment Lines: 56,292
  o Statements: 85,702
