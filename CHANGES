Changes from MFIX 2014-1 (Date: 10/01/2014) to MFIX 2015-1 (Date: 04/03/2015)


New features added:
-------------------

* 2.5D model for cylindrical coordinates – A new method for pseudo
  two-dimensional (2.5D) simulations for cylindrical coordinates is
  available by combining the benefits of Cartesian 2D and axisymmetric
  assumptions.

  Li, T., Benyahia, S., Dietiker, J., Musser, J., and Sun, X. (2015)
  “A 2.5D computational method to simulate cylindrical fluidized beds,”
  Chemical Engineering Science, 123:236-246.

* Runtime Arguments – A simulation can be passed keywords as runtime
  arguments to override or supplement input provided in the mfix.dat
  file.

* Additional VTK Output Capabilities –
  o All simulations using Cartesian coordinates can export data in VTK
    file formats. Previously this file format was limited to Cartesian
    cut-cell based simulations.
  o Users may specify subdomains for data extraction. This allows users
    to save data only in regions of interest thereby reducing overall file
    sizes and simplifying post-processing. See the output controls section
    for details and mfix/tutorials/vtk_regions tutorial for an example.
  o A python script was added under the tools directory to extract ‘probe
    data’ from VTK data files.


Changes in existing features:
-----------------------------

* Arrays for the storage of particle data are automatically grown as 
  the number of particles in the system (or processor) increases. This
  removes guess work to approximate adequate array sizes. As a result,
  the keywords MAX_PIS and PARTICLES_FACTOR were removed. 

* New built in shapes (quadric forms) were added for greater geometrical
  flexibility.

* The DES drag implementation was generalized and a new interpolation
  scheme was incorporated. Users must now specify which interpolation
  scheme is desired. See the DES keywords section for additional details.


* Documentation:

Community Involvement:
------------------

* A new kinetic theory model was implemented for MFIX-TFM.

  three-dimensional simulation of dense multi-phase flows using
  cylindrical coordinates," Powder Technology, 264:242-255.
