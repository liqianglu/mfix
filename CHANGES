Changes from MFIX2005-3 to MFIX2005-4 (Date: 12/12/05)
Changes in existing features:
	* An error in the energy equation introduced in the last version was corrected.  
	* Added/modified some test cases and tutorial cases. 
	* Several more updates for code clean up and for bug fixes - please refer to the CVS 
[1]
 
New features
	* A recently published thermochemical database of Burcat and Ruscic (2005) was 
linked with MFIX.  This gives MFIX users access to accurate thermochemical 
data for over 1300 species, which includes specific heat, enthalpy, entropy, free 
energy, formation enthalpy and molecular weight.  In addition to the improvement 
in the accuracy of the calculations, the linkage with the database eliminates the 
potential for errors when data are entered manually.  The database authors' 
permission was obtained for including it in MFIX; the database can be used only 
for noncommercial work (see the notice in the database) [2].  The rate of reaction 
term is also computed automatically now.  See the readme file for details.
	* A reader for the Paraview visualization software and instructions for using the 
software has been added.
