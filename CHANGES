Changes from MFIX2007-4 (Date: 12/31/2007) to MFIX2010-1 (Date: 02/02/2010)

Changes in existing features:
-----------------------------

   * Bug fixes and enhancements:
      o Solids inventory reporting problem for parallel runs
      o Unit conversion from CGS to SI for dimensional quantities.
      o Print format changes to accommodate processor counts > 100
   * Enhancements:
      o Semi-implicit treatment of IA conductivity term
   * conducted extensive debugging and verification of the DEM code
   * updated DEM test cases
   * Updated documents:
      o Equations document [1]
      o Readme file [2]


New features added:
-------------------

   * HYS polydisperse drag model and test case
      o The Holloway, Yin and Sundaresan (HYS) drag relation accounts for the effect of finite Reynolds 
        number on the fluid-particle drag experienced by particles in polydisperse suspensions.
      o The HYS drag model is described in mfix/doc/HYS_drag.pdf.
   * DEM
      o Expanded DEM code so particles of differing size and density can be modeled (polydispersity).
      o Added a second order integration method (Adams Bashforth) to DEM as an option (DES_INTG_METHOD).
      o Added the Hertzian collision model to DEM as an option (DES_COLL_MODEL).
      o Created an updated user guide/document for the DEM code that includes a discussion on theory, numerics, and the verification tests [3]
   * Cartesian Grid cut cell technique
      o This new capability allows the definition of curved or sloping boundaries, instead of the usual stair-step representation.
      o Computational cells are truncated at the wall to conform to the shape of the boundaries.
      o The Cartesian grid technique is available for the Euler-Euler approach and includes no-slip 
        and free-slip boundary conditions for either gas or solids phases.
      o A user guide describing the utilization of the cut cell technique is located in mfix/doc/Cartesian_grid_user_guide.pdf [4].
      o Some tutorials located at mfix/Cartesian_grid_tutorials illustrate the new capability.
   * Distributed I/O 
   * Option to compile using gfortran


Under development:
------------------

   * GHD (Garzó, Hrenya, and Dufty) granular kinetic theory 
      o Code was updated with GHD granular kinetic theory and a simple shear flow case was added to tests/GHD to show how this model is used.
      o The major difference between this theory and previous KT's that it solves mixture momentum and granular 
        energy equations instead of the individual solids phases equations.
      o Currently this theory is for granular flows (no fluid) and only simple wall BC can be applied (i.e. no slip, free slip)
      o The effect of fluid-solid drag was included in the GHD theory.
   * DEM
      o Adding inlet/outlet capabilities to DEM
