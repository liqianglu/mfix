Changes from MFIX4-2 to MFIX2002-3 (Date: 07/22/02)

a) New version number - representing the year and quarter of release.
b) Parallel capability in the cyclic direction
c) Changed interface drag_gs.f and drag_ss.f.  All drag related arrays are 
   defined in drag_mod.f so that they are not defined at multiple places for 
   efficiency and easy usability. To make old drag_gs.f and drag_ss.f 
   consistent with this change, do the following:
    * remove F_gs (or F_ss) from the argument list
    * Add the statement "Use drag" 
    * delete the dimension statement for drag_gs (or drag_ss)
d) More user defined variables (LEQ_PC, IS_SERIAL) to control the linear solver 
   (see readme file)
e) Benchmarked and documented MFIX for all the tests and tutorials on 
   Linux and Compaq (Look at tests/MFIX_Tests_Benchmarking.html &
   tutorials/MFIX_Tutorials_Benchmarking.html)
f) Many bug-fixes - visit 
   http://www.mfix.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/mfix/model/?sortby=date#dirlist
g) Flushing buffers consistently. This was done as some of the file buffers 
   were not flushed on certain architectures when the code exits.
h) Some bug-fixes (e.g. mass and volume flux calculations correct) and 
   additional features (e.g. time average of SPX files) in post_mfix
i) Added complex-chemistry directory and an example coal gasifier to the base 
   directory
j) Added/modified some test cases and tutorial cases
k) Updated Readme's in the pdf and html formats are distributed along with the
   code
