MFIX to Ensight Translator : m2e

1) to create the translator

   make

2) to convert MFIX RES and SPx files to Ensight

   a. copy the m2e executable to the folder with the MFIX output files
   b. ./m2e RUNNAME

      (i.e. enter the name of the RES file without the .RES)

Note:

I know there is a problem if kepsilon is enabled.  I am looking for my
fix to that now, but thought I would post this anyway.
