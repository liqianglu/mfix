                    ANIMATE-mfix.exe Usage

After starting the program, choose the RESTART file of the
run that you want to animate (uses a file-open dialog).

There are 2 dialogs, one at the bottom and one to the left.

You can resize the entire window or the individual dialogs.


The bottom dialog lets you do the following:

  a) toggle between "go" and "pause" mode (click on the
     button).  Note: on some systems, the "go-mode" does
     not seem to work correctly.  If that is the case,
     stay in "pause-mode" and use the left and right arrows
     as described below.

  b) change the number of plots (variables) displayed

  c) set the min / max to be used to color the variables

  d) set the time while in paused mode (by moving the slider 
     at the bottom of the dialog).

  e) step forward or backwards one time step while in
     paused mode.  Click on the slider and use the 
     left and right arrows to move to the next time step.
     You can "click and hold" the arrow keys to simulate
     the "go" button.


The left dialog lets you do the following:

  a) set whether zooming in/out zooms bot X and Y , X only,
     or Y only.

  b) zoom in , zoom out

  c) reset all zooms and shifts

  d) shift the plot up or down

  e) toggle plotting the mirror image about the center line (K-slices)

  f) create a simple table : set the (i,j,k) cell index and click on
     the "create table" button.  The values over time for the variables
     being plotted will be stored in the use supplied filename (default
     name is table.csv).  The table will also be displayed in a separate
     window.
