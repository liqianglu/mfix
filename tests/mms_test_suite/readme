MMS Test Suite

Notes:

1) mms_test.sh is the main script. This script goes into individual case
folders, and runs various mesh levels. Finally it runs the collect_results.sh
script to collect l2 de norms, linfinity de norms, l2 observed order, and
linfinity observed order into a single file. The final product of this test
suite is the 'mms_test_results.dat' file.

2) Inside individual case folder, observed order files (ooa_l2.dat, and
ooa_linf.dat) can be used to generate order of accuracy plots. Similarly,
de_l2.dat and de_linf.dat can be used to generate discretization error norms
plots. This data is in tecplot readable format.

3) Most cases are set to run for 3 or 4 mesh levels depending on computational
expense and whether the solution is in asymptotic range. Number of mesh levels
to be run can be changed by uncommenting respective lines from the 
"run_cases.sh" script within each case folder.

4) Details of the cases are given in the case_details files.
